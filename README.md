# GIS Jargon for Developers

A collaborative glossary that explains **terms with different meanings in Computer Science and GIS**.  
If you‚Äôve ever wondered why *buffer*, *vector*, *schema*, or *routing* mean one thing in programming and something else in GIS, this repo is for you.

## Why this repo?
GIS documentation often uses words familiar to developers but with completely different meanings.  
On top of that, different organizations and standards use different names for the *same* thing ‚Äî for example:  
- **LineString** in GeoJSON = **Polyline** in Esri
- **Icon** in Leaflet = **PictureMarkerSymbol** in ArcGIS

This glossary helps bridge both kinds of gaps:
- üöß **CS vs GIS**: different meaning for the same word  
- üîÄ **Cross-ecosystem**: different words for the same concept  

## Quick examples

| Term    | Computer Science                                  | GIS                                                           |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Buffer  | Memory area used for I/O                          | Polygon/zone created around a feature                         |
| Vector  | Array or vector                | Geometry made of points, lines, and polygons                  |
| Schema  | Database structure (tables, fields, constraints)  | Tiling schema  |
| Routing | IP packet path selection or mechanism that maps URL paths to specific views or components in a single-page application                          | Finding directions along a road/utility network               |
